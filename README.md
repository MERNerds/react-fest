# React Fest

## Description

This application is target for festival goers. We wanted to create a fun, fictional music festival application that would be more user friendly and accessible than most of the other music festival sites out there.

Upon reaching the homepage, the user will see the logo for React Fest and a list of all the bands featured for the festival. As they scroll down they will be able to see some potential action shots of other festival goers having an excellent time at previous festivals. There will be a link at the top for the user to see the line up for each day of the festival as well. 

When the user clicks to the ticket page, they will be given the options of available tickets for the festival. They are instructed to login or signup in order to purchase tickets.

Once the user has created an account, they will be given a new menu in the top right corner for Schedule, Cart, or Logout. Now they will be able to buy tickets and add them to their cart. They will be alerted that they have items in their cart with a badge icon in the upper right hand corner. 

This app is a test version but it supports the entire ecommerce process. (to test the Stripe, a user can enter 4242 4242 4242 4242 as the card and it will process as a test card). Upon a successful transaction, the user is redirected to the homepage to continue their experience.

They will now have access to their own personal festival schedule. They will be able to see all the set times for each band on each given day. The genres of the bands are color coded as well so that a user can easily distinguish which genre they prefer. The user can drag artists off to the side pannel to remove them from their schedule. They may also add an artist back in from the list and the artist will go to their proper set time slot. 

** Disclaimer: This is a fictional festival. We do not own the rights to any of these bands names and they have not agreed to play at any festival called React Fest at any point in time.
